# Customer Behavior Analysis 

## Overview

This data science project aims to delve into customer behavior by analyzing transaction data. The primary objective is to extract insights into purchasing patterns, preferences, and trends through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises transactional data from various retail stores, offering valuable information for data-driven business decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found here. It encompasses transactional details from multiple retail stores, including product information and purchase amounts. This dataset serves as a rich source for understanding customer behavior and making informed business decisions.

## Code Overview

### Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are utilized to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring that it is ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify patterns, outliers, and trends. Descriptive statistics, data summarization, and visualizations are used to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior captured in the dataset.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a pivotal role in offering a holistic understanding of customer behavior within the dataset. This project incorporates diverse visualizations crafted using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to generate charts, graphs, and plots that illuminate key insights extracted from the data. These visual representations serve as powerful tools to communicate complex patterns and trends in a more accessible manner.

## Conclusion

Through the combined efforts of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques, this project strives to unveil valuable insights into customer behavior derived from transactional data. These insights, showcased through engaging visualizations, can inform strategic business decisions, facilitate the development of personalized marketing strategies, and contribute to overall improvements in customer satisfaction.
